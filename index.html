        <h1>Main heading! It's a heading 1</h1>
        <h2>Paragraphs</h2>
        <p>This is one of my first lines of body code.</p>
        <p>More lines coming your way. Just making paragraphs with "p".</p>
        
        <h2>Strong and emphasized text</h2>
        <p><strong>Here's a strong line of code. Basically just bold.</strong></p>
        <p><em>Here's an "em" one. Just emphasized, italicized code. Takes more importance though.</em></p>
        
        <h2>Comments</h2>
        <p>Comment things out with a command + / shortcut. Easy.</p>
        <!-- Just like this buddy, here's your first comment. Command slash. -->

        <h2>Lists</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>I've just made an unordered list</li>
            <li>To make it, use the element "ul" to open the list.</li>
            <li>Then use the element "li" for every new bullet point.</li>
        </ul>

        <ol>
            <li>This is an ordered list. You create it with an "ol" element.</li>
            <li>It's the same as an unordered list but bullet points are numbered.</li>
        </ol>
    </body>
