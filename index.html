        <h1>Main heading! It's a heading 1</h1>
        <h2>Paragraphs</h2>
        <p>This is one of my first lines of body code.</p>
        <p>More lines coming your way. Just making paragraphs with "p".</p>
        
        <h2>Strong and emphasized text</h2>
        <p><strong>Here's a strong line of code. Basically just bold.</strong></p>
        <p><em>Here's an "em" one. Just emphasized, italicized code. Takes more importance though.</em></p>
        
        <h2>Comments</h2>
        <p>Comment things out with a command + / shortcut. Easy.</p>
        <!-- Just like this buddy, here's your first comment. Command slash. -->

        <h2>Lists</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>I've just made an unordered list</li>
            <li>To make it, use the element "ul" to open the list.</li>
            <li>Then use the element "li" for every new bullet point.</li>
        </ul>

        <ol>
            <li>This is an ordered list. You create it with an "ol" element.</li>
            <li>It's the same as an unordered list but bullet points are numbered.</li>
        </ol>
        
        
        <h2>Links and Images</h2>
        <p>We're going to add a link now. You can do so with an anchor element "a".</p>
        <p>The anchor element needs an href attribute with the url.</p>
        <p>Add a target attribute with value _blank if you want a new tab. Default is _self.</p>
        <p>For security reasons, add a rel attribute with value "noopener noreferrer". Prevents opener and referrer knowledge transmission.</p>
        <a href="https://www.theodinproject.com/about" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">About The Odin Project</a>
        
        <br><br><br>
        <p>Skipping a line by adding 3x page breaks with the "br" element above.</p>
        <p>While the above is an absolute link, the below is a relative link.</p>
        <p>href only requires the name of the file as a value as long as it is in the same directory as the current page.</p>
        <a href="./pages/about.html">About</a>

        <br><br><br>
        <p>To link an image, use the "img" element with a "src" attribute. Add an absolute or relative link to the attribute.</p>
        <p>Add an alt attribute to describe the image if it fails to load. Modify dimensions of the image with the height and width attributes.</p>
